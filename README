## irc_newredditpost_bot

An IRC bot that sends new submissions from a subreddits /new feed to an IRC channel.

Posts are held and displayed in a digest format when requested.
Bot gathers new submissions after they have been alive for a period of time, and meet a karma threshold.
Once a submission has been sent to the IRC channel it will not be sent again.
Posts have a user definable window of opportunity in which new posts can attain positive karma and become eligible for use. 
After this period is over they will no longer be considered.

The window of opportunity is set in config.json by:

"woo_o": int <-(open) 
and 
"woo_c": int <-(close)

The phrase to request bots should contain no whitespace, and is set in config.json by:

"phrase": 'phrase_here'

The rest should be self explainitory.
